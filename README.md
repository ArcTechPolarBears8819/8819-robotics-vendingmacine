# Robot Focus
This robot would be a moving vending machine that goes around the school and sells snacks to students. It would also be able to give free medical aid to any students in need. The robot would also be used to fundraise and sell as concessions during school events (Sports, extracurriculurs, etc). The robot would serve two functions - to deliver snacks to students' classroom and to sell snacks to people during games.
